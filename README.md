📊 Student Performance Predictor

Linear Regression Project

📌 Project Overview

This project predicts student exam scores based on the number of hours studied using Linear Regression.
It demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline — from data loading and visualization to training, evaluation, and prediction.

This is a beginner-friendly but industry-relevant regression problem commonly used in real analytics teams.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains two columns:

Column	Description
Hours	Number of hours studied
Scores	Marks obtained

The data is stored in:

Data.csv

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

🔍 Workflow

Load the dataset using Pandas

Perform basic data inspection

Visualize the relationship between Hours and Scores

Split data into training and testing sets

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE and R² score

Predict marks for new study hours

Plot the regression line

📈 Model Results

The trained model learns the relationship:

Marks ≈ (9.83 × Hours) + 2.44

This means:

Every extra hour studied increases marks by ~9.8 points

The model explains over 98% of the variation in marks (high R²)

🔮 Sample Predictions
Hours Studied	Predicted Marks
8 hours	~81
10 hours	~101
📊 Visualization

The model fits a straight line through the data, showing a strong linear relationship between hours studied and marks.
